Don't Block the Event Loop (or the Worker Pool)

Node.js is fast when work associated with each client at any given time is small.
Node.js uses small number of threads to handle many clients. In Node.js there are two types of threads: one Event Loop (aka the main loop, main thread, event thread, etc.), and a pool of k Workers in a worker pool (aka the threadpool).

Two motivations for blocking neither the Event Loop nor the Worker Pool:
1. Performance: If you regularly perform heavyweight activity on either type of thread, the throughput (requests/second) of your server will suffer.
2. Security: If it is possible that for certain input one of your threads might block, a malicious client could submit this "evil input", make your thread block, and keep then from working on other clients. This would be a Denial of Service attack.
